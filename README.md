## Solution Approach

2. **Styling**: Custom CSS is used for minor design tweaks, while Bootstrap provides the foundation for responsiveness and layout.
3. **Images**: Placeholder images are used for demonstration purposes. You can replace them with actual images as needed.
4. **Links**: Navigation links and buttons direct users to relevant sections of the page.
